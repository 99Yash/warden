 * reference (`results/baseline-m14.json`) and the `--compare baseline …`
 * left-hand side. If this clears the multi-criteria threshold accidentally,
 * M15's whole calibration premise is wrong.
 *
 * `programmatic-dispatch` — Round 0 deterministic fan-out ON, rules-based
 * prompt unchanged. First lever against the M14 boss-laziness evidence.
 *
 * `programmatic-dispatch-examples-first` — Round 0 + examples-first prompt
 * variant. Second lever if `programmatic-dispatch` alone doesn't clear.
 *
 * (Config D — Opus 4.7 fallback — is documented in `m15-plan.md` §Phase 6
 * but not represented here; build only if A–C all fail. Adding it requires
 * exposing a model-override seam on `BossLoopConfig` per the handoff
 * notes.)
